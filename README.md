# PetDB_analysis
Data analysis of sample records from the PetDB database and associated publication metadata from the Web of Science database. The aim of this analysis is to explore geographic patterns of sampling and publishing in analytical geoscience and unpack issues around parachute science. The code is written in Rmarkdown (chunks of R code separated by explanatory text in markdown). The main analysis file is PetDB_data_analysis.Rmd. For a readable version look at the knitted copy PetDB_data_analysis.html
